# Fastest web app

This is going to be the fastest realistic webapp on the planet. I added the word realistic as I understand vanilla JS is fastest, but that is not scalable to a team of engineers working on aproject.

Here is what I am going to do:
1. Use Preact instead of react
2. Use service worker and employ offline cache
3. USe SSR
4. Differential bundling

Also I am going to follow the recommendations of these resources
